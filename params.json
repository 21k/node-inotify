[(ref: GNU/Linux Manual)][inotify.7]\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n[NodeJS][nodejs_dev] versions 0.8.x are currently supported and tested.\r\n\r\n### Install from NPM (Easy way)\r\n    $ npm install inotify\r\n\r\n### Install from git\r\n    $ npm install node-gyp -g\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/c4milo/node-inotify.git\r\n    $ cd node-inotify\r\n    $ node-gyp rebuild\r\n\r\n## API\r\n  * `var inotify = new Inotify()`: Create a new instance of Inotify. By default it's in persistent mode.\r\n  You can specify `false` in `var inotify = new Inotify(false)` to use the non persistent mode.\r\n\r\n  * `var wd = inotify.addWatch(arg)`:  Add a watch for files or directories. This will then return a watch descriptor. The argument is an object as follows\r\n        var arg = { path: 'path to be monitored',\r\n                    watch_for: an optional OR'ed set of events to watch for.\r\n                               If they're not specified, it will use\r\n                               Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS by default,\r\n                    callback: Callback function that will receive each event.\r\n        }\r\nYou can call this function as many times as you want to monitor different paths.\r\n**Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive**: to monitor subdirectories\r\nunder a directory, additional watches must be created.\r\n\r\n  * `inotify.removeWatch(watch_descriptor)`: Remove a watch associated with the watch_descriptor param and returns `true` if the action was succesful or `false` in the opposite case. Removing a watch cause an `Inotify.IN_IGNORED` event to be generated for this watch descriptor.\r\n\r\n  * `inotify.close()`: Remove all the watches and close the inotify's file descriptor. Returns `true` if the action was succesful or false in the opposite case.\r\n\r\n### Event object structure\r\n```javascript\r\n    var event = {   watch: Watch descriptor,\r\n                    mask: Mask of events,\r\n                    cookie: Cookie that permits to associate events,\r\n                    name: Optional name of the object being watched\r\n                };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `event.name` property is only present when an event is returned for a file inside a\r\nwatched directory; it identifies the file pathname relative to the watched\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example of use\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    var Inotify = require('inotify').Inotify;\r\n    var inotify = new Inotify(); //persistent by default, new Inotify(false) //no persistent\r\n\r\n    var data = {}; //used to correlate two events\r\n\r\n    var callback = function(event) {\r\n        var mask = event.mask;\r\n        var type = mask & Inotify.IN_ISDIR ? 'directory ' : 'file ';\r\n        event.name ? type += ' ' + event.name + ' ': ' ';\r\n\r\n        //the porpuse of this hell of 'if'\r\n        //statements is only illustrative.\r\n\r\n        if(mask & Inotify.IN_ACCESS) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'was accessed ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MODIFY) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'was modified ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_OPEN) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'was opened ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE) {\r\n            console.log(type + ' opened for reading was closed ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE) {\r\n            console.log(type + ' opened for writing was closed ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_ATTRIB) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'metadata changed ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CREATE) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'created');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_DELETE) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'deleted');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_DELETE_SELF) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'watched deleted ');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVE_SELF) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'watched moved');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_IGNORED) {\r\n            console.log(type + 'watch was removed');\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVED_FROM) {\r\n            data = event;\r\n            data.type = type;\r\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVED_TO) {\r\n            if( Object.keys(data).length &&\r\n                data.cookie === event.cookie) {\r\n                console.log(type + ' moved to ' + data.type);\r\n                data = {};\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    var home_dir = { path:      '/home/camilo', // <--- change this for a valid directory in your machine.\r\n                     watch_for: Inotify.IN_OPEN | Inotify.IN_CLOSE,\r\n                     callback:  callback\r\n                  };\r\n\r\n    var home_watch_descriptor = inotify.addWatch(home_dir);\r\n\r\n    var home2_dir = { path:      '/home/bob', // <--- change this for a valid directory in your machine\r\n                      watch_for: Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS,\r\n                      callback:  callback\r\n                  };\r\n\r\n    var home2_wd = inotify.addWatch(home2_dir);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Inotify Events\r\n\r\n### Watch for:\r\n * **Inotify.IN_ACCESS:** File was accessed (read)\r\n * **Inotify.IN_ATTRIB:** Metadata changed, e.g., permissions, timestamps, extended attributes, link count (since Linux 2.6.25), UID, GID, etc.\r\n * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE:** File opened for writing was closed\r\n * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE:** File not opened for writing was closed\r\n * **Inotify.IN_CREATE:** File/directory created in the watched directory\r\n * **Inotify.IN_DELETE:** File/directory deleted from the watched directory\r\n * **Inotify.IN_DELETE_SELF:** Watched file/directory was deleted\r\n * **Inotify.IN_MODIFY:** File was modified\r\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVE_SELF:** Watched file/directory was moved\r\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVED_FROM:** File moved out of the watched directory\r\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVED_TO:** File moved into watched directory\r\n * **Inotify.IN_OPEN:** File was opened\r\n * **Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS:** Watch for all kind of events\r\n * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE:**  (IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE)  Close\r\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVE:**  (IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO)  Moves\r\n\r\n### Additional Flags:\r\n * **Inotify.IN_ONLYDIR:** Only watch the path if it is a directory.\r\n * **Inotify.IN_DONT_FOLLOW:** Do not follow symbolics links\r\n * **Inotify.IN_ONESHOT:** Only send events once\r\n * **Inotify.IN_MASK_ADD:** Add (OR) events to watch mask for this pathname if it already exists (instead of replacing the mask).\r\n\r\n### The following bits may be set in the `event.mask` property returned in the callback\r\n * **Inotify.IN_IGNORED:** Watch was removed explicitly with inotify.removeWatch(watch_descriptor) or automatically (the file was deleted, or the file system was unmounted)\r\n * **Inotify.IN_ISDIR:** Subject of this event is a directory\r\n * **Inotify.IN_Q_OVERFLOW:** Event queue overflowed (wd is -1 for this event)\r\n * **Inotify.IN_UNMOUNT:** File system containing the watched object was unmounted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Camilo Aguilar.
